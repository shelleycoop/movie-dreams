    <h1>Movie Dreams</h1>
    <p>
      This website is from a fanboy(and being a movie fanboy might be telling a
      lot more than the term sports fanboy) as a continuing tribute to their
      best works or any works on a large or small scale. Here you might find a
      blog on one of their movies or, if you are lucky, entire filmographies.
      Thought to tell you beforehand. The content will receive weekly updates.
      So feel free to keep checking out. And do drop your own favorites on which
      you might want to read something of my thoughts, not that they are pure
      gold.
