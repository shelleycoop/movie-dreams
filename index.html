    <p>
      This website is from a fanboy as a continuing tribute to their best works
      or any works on a large or small scale. Here you might find a blog on one
      of their movies or, if you are lucky, entire filmographies. Thought to
      tell you beforehand. The content will receive weekly updates. So feel free
      to keep checking out. And do drop your own favorites on which you might
      want to read something of my thoughts.
