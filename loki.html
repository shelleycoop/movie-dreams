    <h1>LOKI - The Mystery of Existence</h1>
    <p>
        The world we live in is full of mysteries beyond our comprehension. We choose to ignore those mysteries
        but that doesn't deny their existence. There is much of science fiction that focuses on this particular 
        theme and Loki is one of them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In its two seasons the series has explored multiple ways through which lives are connected and how we find
        our meaning and purpose in life and beyond. By the end of season two Loki's glorious purpose is revealed to him 
        and he realises that it also is a burden that he himself has to carry. It also means that he has to leave everything
        that is going on in his life and be a silent guardian to a universe that doesn't know what he has done for them. 
        This makes for a very alienated prospect as far as Loki is concerned but this is one duty that he doesn't refuse.
        He can't refuse or escape this. He has to sacrifice himself because the odds are really big in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
        In all the early years we had always seen Loki as a villain first but here he takes his place as a just and 
        benevolent god.
