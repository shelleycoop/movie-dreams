    <h2>Kubrick's influence is everlasting on cinema</h2>
    <p>
      Kubrick has produced such rich works that we can put him onto a high
      pedestal and revere him as a master of the cinema and its methodologies.
      Here in my blog we will go over all the major movies that have been
      directed by Kubrick and also look at some of his lesser known movies that
      came at the beginning of his career. So without waiting let us start. And
      why don't we start at that one that has us going wild with us amazement
      and puzzle even after half a century of its release!

      Kubrick for me is known for his enigmatic slow form of storytelling that
      can be famously realised in his 1975 movie Barry Lyndon. The story
      captivates at the level of the soul with its keen exploration of the lead
      character and his rise and fall. We come to despise him at a point in the
      story but by then we have already felt pity on him which also happens at
      the end of it. But at the end it is real cinema. It makes us think about
      ourselves and think critically.
